        <h3> Hey there, partner. We're here to guide you on your travels accross our expansive state of Texas. This here Texan Museum Tour doubles as a day planner and platform where folks can share any museum they may stumble on. We've taken care of a few institutional standards with room for quirkier, lowbudget museums with a specific niche. Here, you are able to track museums you may want to visit while adding them to a list! Name your list, edit the list, check out exhibitions through our the provided lists, and have a grand time. Big Texas, Big culture, Big grounds. <em>You smell what I'm stepping in?</em> That's Texan for, <em>"Do you understand what I'm saying?"</em></h3>
